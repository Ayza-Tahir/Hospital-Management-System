# Hospital-Management-System C++ Binary Search Tree-Linked List
In this C++ program, three classes are implemented: "PatientRecord," "TNode," and "HospitalRecord." The "PatientRecord" class manages patient data, while "TNode" class defines nodes for a binary search tree (BST). The "HospitalRecord" class maintains the BST using a linked list approach.

Users can input patient data, which is inserted into the BST. The program then verifies whether the tree is a BST. Additionally, users can perform search, edit, and removal operations on patient records.

The BST output is displayed in different ways: inorder, preorder, postorder, and level order traversals. Moreover, the program provides the total number of patient records in the hospital dataset.

Furthermore, the program separates and displays patient records based on their admission or discharge status, offering a comprehensive overview of hospital data. The code showcases the functionalities of linked list-based BST, data manipulation, and tree traversal techniques in a hospital management system
